# e-YRC 2014 Waste Segregating
This repo contains all documents and code which we developed during e-Yantra National Robotics Competition 2014. Our theme was waste segregation, in that we had to design Robot which can segregate waste of different size and color and deposits to given location by traversing a very complex path.

## Final thought 
- We successfully completed Task-0,1 & 2 and secured rank in top 3. Unfortunately due to the failure of the robot hardware, lack of time and kills we were unable to submit final task.
- Lesson learned from the competition especially from failure helped us a lot to secured 5th Rank in this e-yantra competition in 2015.
